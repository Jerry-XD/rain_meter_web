# Angular 13 Firebase CRUD example with Realtime DataBase | AngularFireDatabase

Build Angular 13 CRUD App with Firebase Realtime Database that uses `AngularFireDatabase` service.

- Each Tutorial has key, title, description, published status.
- We can make CRUD operations: create, retrieve, update, delete Tutorials.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

node-v12.20.2-x64

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

ng build --prod --build-optimizer --base-href /student/supachai.kn/project/ --deploy-url /student/supachai.kn/project/
ng build --prod --build-optimizer --base-href /student/supachai.kn/web/ --deploy-url /student/supachai.kn/web/

ng build --build-optimizer --base-href /student/supachai.kn/project/

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
